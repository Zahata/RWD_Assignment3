# RWD_Assignment3
This is my RWD assignment where I should use my JavaScript and jQuery knowledge to be able to manipulate objects from the HTML file. 
Pointing on the blue fish it should make it go to a random position.
Clicking the golden fish should make it`s size bigger.
And clicking on the baloon it should pop it.
